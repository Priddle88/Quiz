# Quiz

I have to say that I still have a long way to go. I want to make it so that the names will display in an ordered list at the end.
I will be working on this for the next couple of days.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

I am going to be adding a way to add the highscores in order from greatest to least and be better about repeating the quiz's.
