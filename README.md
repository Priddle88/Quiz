# Quiz

I realized that I could add, remove, and edit elements on the page using javascript. I used that method to "switch pages" and to basically write the whole thing. I made each page a function and called each function when the user would click one of the buttons. I used the set interval function to create the clock.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

# In Conclusion

I realized that I would burn myself by looking at a screen for too long. I needed to get out when I would come back everything made more sense. The hardest part for me was displaying the highscores in a list and also managing the elements on the page. I need to make sure the were shown and hidden when needed.
